      "RentPay Reminder was born after my third 'final notice' letter. It sends notifications before rent is due, tracks payment history, and even suggests freelance opportunities when your bank account is looking as empty as my fridge the day before payday. The app has saved me from eviction at least twice, which means I've saved enough on moving costs to afford another year of anime subscriptions.",

      "The main challenge was creating a system that could integrate with various payment platforms while being more reliable than my promises to 'watch just one more episode' before bed. Also, convincing my landlord to accept partial payments in the form of 'I'll fix your website' was surprisingly difficult.",
    solutions:
      "I implemented OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and used Plaid API for safe bank account integration. The notification system is more persistent than a shounen protagonist facing the final boss. It starts with gentle reminders 10 days before rent is due, escalating to panic mode with flashing red alerts and automatic job search queries by day 3.",
